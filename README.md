# DataMigrationFromMySqlToMongoDB

This project will provide the generalized tool that will help any organization or individual to migrate the data from MySQL to MongoDB. With the increase in data, many companies are facing different problems in terms of scalability, performance, etc., therefore they are migrating to NOSQL so this tool will be the solution to their problem. All the database tables have their own functionality and their design is based on database operations. So, this tool will provide both the options to automate the migration process and customize the data modeling so that the database will continue to provide the functionality in MongoDB similar way of MySQL but with high performance.

This tool will be able to implement six Thumbs rule of MongoDB. In automatic process, only three of the rules will be applicable because system cannot identify which columns to be denormalized and the significance of the columns whereas in manual process, all the six rules will be applicable. Also, there is efficient logic to prevent the loss of data and replication of data while migrating.
